# Qobuz for Lidarr
This plugin provides a Qobuz indexer and downloader client for Lidarr.

## Installation

## Licensing
Code from [QobuzDowloaderX-MOD](https://github.com/DJDoubleD/QobuzDownloaderX-MOD), under the [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/DJDoubleD/QobuzDownloaderX-MOD?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme) was used in this project.

These libraries have been merged into the final plugin assembly due to (what I believe is) a bug in Lidarr's plugin system.
